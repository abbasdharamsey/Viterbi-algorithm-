We were tasked with applying the Viterbi Algorithm to a discrete Hidden Markov Model to show how the same algorithm is used for automatic speech recognition. In a normal speech recognizer, the observations are derived from real valued measurements of acoustic waveforms. Here, the observations only take on binary values but the concepts are the same. 

The HMM has n=26 hidden states St {1, 2, ... , z} and binary observations Ot {0,1}.

There are 3 ascii data files:

1. Initial state distribution
2. Transition matrix
3. Emission matrix.

To run the code, have Python 2.7 installed:

1. python hw5.py

It takes a few minutes to run. 

Please read the hw5_wi15.pdf for more details.
